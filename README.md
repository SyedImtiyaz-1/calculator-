<h3>Calculator Using HTML, CSS, Javascript</h3>
<h4>Why this as a project ?</h4>
      <p>As a Student, I want to upgrade my basic skills first because <strong>basic mastery is the key</strong> to achieve <strong>Success.</strong> 
<h4>How I design or created calculator ?</h4>
<p>
First I added <strong>!DOCTYPE html full code </strong> then div's and input for the textarea which is white in color where you can see numbers whenever you entered it.
<br> Then, I started adding some css stuffs to make my calculator good and responsive. <br>
Finally, I added <strong>Javascript</strong> which is the brain of my calculator you can check my <strong>repo</strong> that I expresed my logic in it.
